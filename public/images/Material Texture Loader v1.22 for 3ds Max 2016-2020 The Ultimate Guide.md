# How to Create PBR Materials in 3ds Max with Material Texture Loader v1.22
 
If you are looking for a fast and easy way to create realistic materials in 3ds Max, you might want to check out the Material Texture Loader script by Martin Krasemann. This script allows you to quickly load in textures, create a material and apply that to your scene. It works both with PBR, Specular and Metallic workflows, but it can be used for any type of texture that needs to be loaded as part of a material.

In this article, we will show you how to use the Material Texture Loader v1.22 script to create PBR materials in 3ds Max 2016-2020. We will also cover some of the features and benefits of this script, such as texture channel recognition, live material creation and editing, advanced map and parameter setups, UDIM texture set support, displacement and UVW map modifiers, and compatibility with various renderers.
 
## What is Material Texture Loader?
 
Material Texture Loader is a 3ds Max script that simplifies the process of creating materials from textures. It automatically recognizes the texture channels based on industry standard name filters and customizable names, and creates all the required maps with correct gamma for each corresponding material channel. You can also adjust the mapping and material parameters on the fly, and the script will update the material accordingly.
 
The script supports Vray, Corona, Redshift, Arnold, FStorm, Octane, Physical and Standard texture maps and materials. It also supports UDIM texture sets for 3ds Max 2017+ and Arnold Legacy maps. You can easily apply the materials to selected objects, material editor or drag and drop them into the viewport. You can also add displacement and UVW map modifiers and control the displacement height and offset.

## How to Use Material Texture Loader?
 
To use the Material Texture Loader script, you need to have some textures ready for your material. You can use any source of textures, such as Substance Painter, Quixel Mixer, Poliigon or online libraries. The script will recognize the texture channels based on their names, so make sure they follow a consistent naming convention. For example, you can use \_basecolor for diffuse/albedo, \_normal for normal map, \_roughness for roughness/glossiness map, \_metallic for metallic/specular map, \_height for displacement map, etc.
 
Once you have your textures ready, follow these steps to create a PBR material in 3ds Max:
 
1. Run the Material Texture Loader script from the Scripting menu or by dragging it into the viewport.
2. Select the renderer you want to use from the drop-down menu at the top of the script window.
3. Click on the Load Textures button and browse to the folder where your textures are located.
4. Select all the textures you want to load and click Open.
5. The script will automatically create a material with all the maps assigned to their respective channels. You can see a preview of the material in the script window or in the material editor.
6. You can adjust the mapping and material parameters in the script window or in the material editor. The script will update the material accordingly.
7. You can also add displacement and UVW map modifiers by clicking on their buttons in the script window. You can control the displacement height and offset in the Displacement section.
8. To apply the material to your scene, you can either select an object and click on Apply Material To Selection button, or drag and drop the material from the script window or from the material editor into the viewport.

That's it! You have created a PBR material in 3ds Max with Material Texture Loader v1.22.
 
## Conclusion
 
Material Texture Loader is a handy script that can save you a lot of time and hassle when creating materials in 3
